# Unity Preferences
My very personal Unity 3D preferences including our current Neopoly code conventions.

## Visual Studio Settings
These settings were set up and exported from Visual Studio Community 2015. Should work with previous or later versions, too.

Import Visual Studio settings via `Tools -> Import/Export settings` from the menu bar.
